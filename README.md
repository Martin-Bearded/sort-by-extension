# sort-by-extension
Python code, that will sort all files by their extensions

Small changes from other sorting codes,
that this will work with files with the same name
by adding _1 _2 _3 ect to the end of file name

Example:
    Folder: txt
        Files: file.txt, file_1.txt, file_2.txt
    Folder: py
        Files: sort.py, sort_1.py, sort_2.py
